Requirements
===
Pytorch 1.2 or 1.3
Python 3.7

Getting started
===
(1)	You can call the function MyEnsemble() in MyEnsemble.py to train the deep Ensemble proposed in our paper.\n
(2)	EnsembleV2.py is the deep Ensemble proposed in our paper. \n
(3)	CifarImbalanced.py is the code used to create imbalanced CIFAR dataset.
(4)	ForcalLossV5.py is the Loss Function proposed in our paper.
